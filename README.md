## Course Code: CS701

## Simultors used: 

 - MIPS --> QtSpim simultor.
 - x86  --> MASM and emu8086 simultors. 




### Programing Questions:

Write the MIPS-I and x86 assembly code to perform these tasks.
1. Load two 32b constants into two registers. Add them and store the sum in a third register.

2. Hello World Program. Print \Hello World" on the output screen.

3. Initialize a contiguous chunk of memory to contain 10 two digit decimal numbers. Your program should
calculate the sum of these numbers and put the result into a memory location following the array.

4. Read in integers repeatedly and calculate the running sum. Stop the program when input is a negative number.
At this point, print the calculated sum and exit the program.

5. Reverse a string (choose your favorite string as a global parameter). Use function

6. Calculate the factorial of a positive integer using (a) loops, (b) recursive procedure calls. The input may be
initialized in the program.

7. Implement a matrix multiplication program using functions. Two 3*3 matrices may be initialized in the data
segment.

8. Read a positive integer and print its equivalent in words. Eg. If input is 123, output will be One Two Three.
Stop the program when a negative number is entered.

9. Compute and print the first 100 prime numbers. Implement the following two procedures:
* test prime(n) - Return 1 if n is prime, else 0.
* main - Iterates over integers, testing if each is prime. Print the first 100 numbers that are prime.

10. A recursive program for solving the classic mathematical recreation, the Towers of Hanoi puzzle.
